    <h2>Relevant Class Projects</h2>
    <p>Below are some class projects that enhanced my communication skills and understanding</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/Training Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Communication Effectiveness Training</a></li>
                <p>For this project, I was a part of a team that evaluated a willing local business
                     for communication issues that we could help train them on. We chose effective communication by management
                    as our topic and presented this training plan as well as engaging the employees of the 
                business so that we could gain experience training skills in a professional environment.</p>
            <li><a href="/Workflow Chart.jpg" target="_blank">Organizational Workflow Chart</a></li>
                    <p>For this project, I was tasked with observing and recording communication flow within my workplace.
