    <h1>Relevant Projects</h1>
    <p>Below are some class projects that enhanced my communication skills and understanding</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/Training Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Communication Effectiveness Training</a></li>
                <p>For this project, I was a part of a team that evaluated a willing local business
                     for communication issues that we could help train them on. We chose effective communication by management
                    as our topic and presented this training plan as well as engaging the employees of the 
                business so that we could gain experience training skills in a professional environment.</p>
            <li><a href="/Workflow Chart.jpg" target="_blank">Organizational Workflow Chart</a></li>
                    <p>For this project, I was tasked with observing and recording communication flow within my workplace.

 <div id="Resume Consultations">
<h1>Resume Consultations</h1>
<p>Based off of training from several interviewing and recruiting classes during my time at Baylor, I am making
    myself available for hire to consult on your resume! I can edit a current resume to ensure an increase in responses by employers 
    and recruiters for $12 per hour. Or, should you feel the need, you can feed me your relevant information and I will create the resume
    for you at $15 per hour. Hours will be logged on a Google Doc shared with whomever enlists my services. Email me at the address below with either "Editing" or "Creating"
    in the subject line.
